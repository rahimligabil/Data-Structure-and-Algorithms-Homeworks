# Data Structure and Algorithms Homeworks

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** assignments implemented in **Java** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

All implementations were written as part of an advanced university-level course and tested using modern software engineering practices.

## Covered Topics

The project includes full implementations and in-depth practice on the following major DSA topics:

### Core Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
- Stacks
- Queues
- HashSet, HashMap (custom implementations)
- Priority Queue (Min/Max Heap)
- Skip List (if implemented)

###  Tree and Graph Structures
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- AVL Tree
- 2-3 Tree
- B-Tree
- Graph Representations (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Topological Sort, etc.)

### Sorting Algorithms
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Timsort (if applicable)

###  Algorithm Analysis
- Time and Space Complexity Analysis (Big-O notation)
- Recursive Algorithms
- Divide & Conquer techniques
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming (if included)

## Software Engineering Practices

- **Unit Testing** using JUnit for each data structure and algorithm.
- **Code modularity** via packages, interfaces, and abstract classes.
- **Docker** integration for environment consistency and automated testing.
- JavaDocs and in-line comments for clarity and maintainability.
